                There was a TV movie in 1996 which covers the Eighth Doctor.
                In 2005 the show is revived for another round.
                This period is known as New Who and consists of Doctors Nine through Thirteen.
                In 2023 the show writer that was in charge during the first 5 years of New Who reclaimed his
